# Asteroids

This repository holds a zip file with the files associated with my work on a copy of the game Asteroids. It uses dynamically linked objects in C++ to create a triangle spaceship and the asteroid polygons it destroys. Download the zip and open the executable to see Asteroids in action.
To play, the user uses the up, down, right, and left arrow keys to add thrust and direction to the spaceship. The user presses the space bar to shoot rockets from the spaceship to destroy the asteroids. Careful though, the asteroids may not fully disappear at the first shot! Watch out for collisions as well...
